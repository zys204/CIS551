1. It would prevent the length extension attack as it would require two hashes of the message using the user's password, generating an inner and outer key - the MAC would ensure integrity of the message, and prevent it from being edited via the length extension, and the attacker would not be able to hash the message without the password.
2. By finding a collision in digital signatures, an attacker would be able to execute a malicious program that is verified by the operating system, since the digital signature of the malicious program would be the same as the benign program.
3. Bleichenbacher's attack would not work against hashes with a high public exponent, because an attacker would not be able to take the exact (or simplify the equation) of a 16th root, and therefore it would not be able to provide an exact signature that would verify.
